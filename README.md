# Operator Spelunking Tools

This repository contains code and some output for gathering information about Mathematica's operators. This is mostly just a brain dump—it lacks adequate documentation and is not the most organized, but it should mostly be self explanatory. If you have a question, first consult the sources I link to below. If you still have a question, feel free to reach out. 

For reference: [Part 1](https://www.robertjacobson.dev/posts/2018-08-16-defining-the-wolfram-language-part-1-finding-operators/) and [Part 2](https://www.robertjacobson.dev/posts/2018-09-04-defining-the-wolfram-language-part-2-operator-properties/) of my article on finding all Mathematica operators. These articles contain a lot more detail about the various sources of information for Mathematica operators, their limitations, how and why some of the sources shouldn't be trusted, and so on.

[Here's an HTML rendering of my operator database](https://wltools.github.io/LanguageSpec/Specification/Syntax/OperatorTableHTML/). I also have it in [Excel and CSV formats online](https://wltools.github.io/LanguageSpec/Specification/Syntax/OperatorTable/).

Most of my work documenting details of the language has been done using Mathematica versions 10 through 13, but mostly with version 11. Whenever a new version was released, I'd check that all my data was still correct.
