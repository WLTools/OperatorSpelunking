`1//..9`  is `` ReplaceRepeated[1, 0.9`] ``
`1//.9` is `ReplaceRepeated[1, 9]` should be `0.9[1]`
`1/.9` is `` Times[1, Power[0.9`, -1]] ``
`1...9` is `9 ((1)...)` or `Hold[Times[RepeatedNull[1], 9]]`
`7//.9` is `ReplaceRepeated[7, 9]`
`7// .9` is `` 0.9`[7] ``
`1/.1->2` is `10. -> 2`

`7// .9` is ``0.9`[7]``


``b; 7`b`` is `7. b`
`_.1` is `Times[Optional[Blank[]], 1]`


Rule: If `.` can be interpreted as part of an operator, it will be. The only exceptions are:
	b=.1
	a/:b=.1
	a/.1
	a.b (* The Dot operator. *)
This places the precedence of the decimal point between `//.` and `/.`â€”excepting for the `Dot` operator itself.
